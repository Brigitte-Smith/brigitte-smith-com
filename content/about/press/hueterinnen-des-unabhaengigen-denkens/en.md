# Red Women - Guardians of independent thinking

Commentary from Verena von Gagern-Steidle to an exhibition

Conspiciously uninfluencable by the cultural currents and
norms of her time Brigitte Smith develops an incomparable,
dancerly diverse visual language for the expression
of an inner force out of which she lives and
which urges her to work in order to share it.
Whatever mode of expression she may choose –
drawing, collage, pigment on paper, painting or sculpture –
she applies to it a unique precision and an independent
urge towards form.
