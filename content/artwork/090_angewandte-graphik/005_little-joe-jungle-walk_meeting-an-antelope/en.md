5. Suddenly a lovely antelope came out of the bushes. O, little Joe, can I please have your blanket to cover my new borne kid? Little Joe gave here the blanket. In return he received a golden mango fruit from the antelope mother.

From a story for a 4 year old child.
"Little Joe making a jungle walk."
