6. Little Joe walked on and on and got very tired. Deep in the forest he met an elephant mother with her child. "Little Joe,", said the elephant, "you are so tired, I will carry you home." Before that they ate the golden mango fruit with eachother.

From a story for a 4 year old child.
"Little Joe making a jungle walk."
